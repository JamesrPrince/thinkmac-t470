## Introduction

## Disclaimer
 I highly recommend pulling and decompiling your own DSDT to apply any static patches as mine may not allow your system to boot. There are plently of detailed guides to figure this part out but essentially you'll be extracting the ACPI files (press F4 on the Clover boot menu which will silently copy these to `/EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/origin`), decompiling them with a tool called `iasl` and using another tool called `MaciASL` to apply the patches and compile the DSDT.

**Make sure you keep a disassembled copy of your DSDT that you apply patches to and then compile for use. If you don't, you'll have to reapply any previous patches each time you use another. I also recommend keeping a working backup of your DSDT.aml and DSDT.dsl files in the event a patch causes issues.**

## Tools

- USB flash drive with macOS Installer & CLOVER
  - Windows - [gibMacOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS)
  - macOS & Linux - [macos_usb](https://github.com/notthebee/macos_usb)
- Clover Configurator
- iasl (needed to decompile ACPI files)
- MaciASL (needed to patch and compile ACPI files)
- IORegistryExplorer (good for troubleshooting and needed to create custom SSDT for USBInjectAll)

## Getting Started

Everything described below is already contained in the EFI folder, though some kexts may not be the latest version available by the time you read this. Since not all models of the ThinkPad T470 are completely the same, I'm including the methods I used to get the individual devices working which can be cherrypicked to finalize your setup.

### Minimum required to boot installer

If you're just getting started and you've got yourself a bootable USB installer with CLOVER loaded on it, go ahead and install these kexts to `/EFI/CLOVER/kexts/Other` and place the config.plist under `/EFI/CLOVER`. I found these necessary to get the installer running and macOS installed. Most things such as battery status, brightness control, audio, etc. will not work but that's expected.

- [config.plist for HD 520](https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-Clover-Laptop-Config/blob/master/config_HD515_520_530_540.plist)
- [Lilu](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu)
- [WhateverGreen](https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen)
- VirtualSMC
  - SMCBatteryManager
  - SMCLightSensor
  - SMCProcessor
  - SMCSuperIO
- VoodooPS2Controller (RehabMan's version)
- IntelMausiEthernet
- USBInjectAll

## Battery

Since the ThinkPad T470 has two batteries (internal & removable), we need to use a patch that will present both batteries as one to the system. From this repo, grab `SSDT-BATC-T470.aml` and place it under `/EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/patched`.

Now in order to get the battery status indicator working, we need to apply a DSDT hotpatch via Clover Configurator. Open the config.plist from your EFI partition in Clover Configurator and select ACPI from the sidebar. Under DSDT\Patches we'll add these four `change Notify` lines:

![battery-notify](/Extras/battery-notify.png)

## Audio
In order to get the ALC298 chipset working, we'll need to make use of [AppleALC.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleALC) (which requires [Lilu.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu)). Download the latest versions and place them under `/EFI/CLOVER/kexts/Other`.

Now that we have the plugin, we need to tell Clover how to use it. Open your config.plist in Clover Configurator and use one of the two methods below:

1. **Add property under Devices\Properties:**

  ![img_applealc_config](/Extras/applealc-config.png)

2. **Add boot argument under Boot\Arguments:** `alcid=47`

> _**Tip:** Try running `lspci | grep audio` or `aplay -l` from a Linux live USB to find which codec your system has (e.g. ALC298)._


## Ethernet

Getting the onboard network adapter working only requires placing [IntelMausiEthernet](https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-Intel-Network) under `/EFI/CLOVER/kexts/Other`.
    
> _**Warning:** For some reason, I couldn't get this to work with the installer so I used a USB to Ethernet adapter. Once macOS was installed I was able to use the onboard network adapter._


## Backlight

The backlight works but we need to be able to control its brightness. Place the `SSDT-PNLF.aml` from my EFI folder inside of the `/EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/patched` directory and put [AppleBacklightFixup.kext](https://github.com/RehabMan/AppleBacklightFixup) under `/EFI/CLOVER/kexts/Other`. These alone should give you control of the backlight under System Preferences.

In order to control the backlight using the brightness keys involves patching the DSDT.

  -  Brightness Controls
     > _**Note:** My model's brightness keys (Fn+F5 & Fn+F6) uses ACPI not PS2. To determine the key name (\_Q14, \_Q15 below) please see RehabMan's [ACPIDebug.kext](https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-ACPI-Debug)._
     > _**Compatibility Note:** If using ACPIDebug.kext to determine keys, syslog/Console.app will not show these anymore. From Terminal run `log show --last 5 | grep ACPIDebug` instead._

     - *Requires DSDT patch; my model uses LPC**B**.KBD **not** LPC.PS2M or LPC.PS2K*

            Method (_Q14, 0, NotSerialized)  // _Qxx: EC Query
            {

                // Brightness Up
                Notify(\_SB.PCI0.LPCB.KBD, 0x0206)
                Notify(\_SB.PCI0.LPCB.KBD, 0x0286)

            }

            Method (_Q15, 0, NotSerialized)  // _Qxx: EC Query
            {

                // Brightness Down
                Notify(\_SB.PCI0.LPCB.KBD, 0x0205)
                Notify(\_SB.PCI0.LPCB.KBD, 0x0285)

            }

## Touchpad

> _**Info:** For my Synaptics touchpad, I was able to get it working using RehabMan's VoodooPS2Controller.kext but tluck's SSDT-Thinkpad_Clickpad patch was required to enable the PrefPane. Multi-touch gestures are fairly limited. You can utilize two finger scrolling but swiping to go back a page in Safari, pinch-to-zoom and rotate don't work. I would also recommend disabling tap-to-click as this caused the cursor to intermittently jump to a second position on the screen if you touched the touchpad simultaneoulsy with a second finger._

> _**Note:** To enable three finger gesture for ExposÃ© you must define the gesture as a keyboard shortcut under SysPrefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts. Under Mission Control, select Application Windows and make the gesture on the touchpad to set it._

## USB (Camera, USB ports, etc.)
> Coming soon

## Power Management (Sleep, wake, battery life, etc.)
> Coming soon

## Post-installation work (Serial, UUID)
Make sure you generate a new serial number and UUID in Clover Configurator to avoid any conflicts with iCloud, iMessage, etc. I've removed some of my unique identifiers so they
